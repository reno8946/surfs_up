# Surfs_Up_Analysis

## Overview of Surfs Up Analysis
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Surfs Up Analysis Results

-One key difference between the June and December Analysis is that the average temperature for June was 74.94 degrees F, while the average temperature for December was 71.04 degrees F

-June had a minimum temperature of 64 degrees F, while December had a minimum temperature of 56 degrees F

-June had a maximum temperature of 85 degrees F, while December had a maximum temperature of 83 degrees F

## Surfs Up Analysis Summary

Considering the average temperature in both June and December is in the low to mid 70's with only about a 4 degree difference, Oahi would be an ideal location to open and operate the ice cream and surf shop, as it would likely be sustainable year-round when factoring for weather specifically. It would be interesting to see the average temperatures across all 12 months and for a 5 year duration to provide an even better picture. While the summer months will definitely bring in tourists from around the globe, you can count on business to do well during the winter months when tourists from cold parts of the country and world will come through to keep things running consistently. I would additionaly query for the average age of the toursits coming in both months because the older crowd may not be as likely to go surfing, but may conversely be more likely to eat ice cream, while the younger crowd may be more likely to go surfing and also consume ice cream. Finally querying the wind speed during both months can provide better insight into which time of the year is best for surfing a catching a big/good wave.
